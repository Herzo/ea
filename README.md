# Einstein’s Agent
Einstein’s Agent uses OAuth 1.0 and 2.0 for Qt (https://github.com/pipacs/o2) for connecting to Khan Academy, so in addition to Qt (http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/) you will need to pull "OAuth 1.0 and 2.0 for Qt" down to a folder beside your project. (If you get the error "No rule to make target" - then check that the */o2/src/* entries in your project file are pointin to the right folder.)
